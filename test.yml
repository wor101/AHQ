    A whole lot of text that doesn't really matter. 
    I included the > key above to tell YAML to render 
    it as a single line which is pretty awesome if you 
    ask me. None of this formating is preserved.
  history: |
    The vertical bar above tells YAML to preserve my formating.
    This means each line will appear as written here.
    Yay!
